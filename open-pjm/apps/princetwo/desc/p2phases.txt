Here are the PRINCE2 project phases and their key activities:

Starting up a Project: The goal of this phase is to determine whether the project is viable and to establish a solid foundation for the project. Key activities include appointing a project manager, defining the project scope, identifying stakeholders, and preparing a high-level plan.

Initiating a Project: In this phase, a detailed project plan is created, and the project is formally approved to move forward. Key activities include developing a project charter, creating a detailed project plan, identifying risks and issues, and establishing a project governance structure.

Directing a Project: This phase is focused on monitoring the project's progress and ensuring that it remains aligned with the business objectives. Key activities include providing direction and guidance to the project manager, monitoring progress against the plan, and making decisions about any changes that need to be made.

Controlling a Stage: In this phase, the project manager focuses on day-to-day management of the project, ensuring that work is being carried out according to the plan, and addressing any issues that arise. Key activities include monitoring progress, managing risks and issues, and updating the project plan.

Managing Product Delivery: This phase focuses on the actual delivery of the project's products, including ensuring that they are completed on time, to budget, and to the required quality standards. Key activities include creating detailed product descriptions, monitoring progress against delivery targets, and reviewing and accepting completed products.

Managing a Stage Boundary: This phase marks the end of each stage of the project and involves reviewing the completed work and determining whether the project should continue to the next stage. Key activities include reviewing progress against the plan, updating the project plan, and making decisions about whether to continue or stop the project.

Closing a Project: The final phase involves closing the project and capturing lessons learned for future projects. Key activities include formalizing the acceptance of the project's products, completing final reporting and documentation, and conducting a project review to capture lessons learned.
