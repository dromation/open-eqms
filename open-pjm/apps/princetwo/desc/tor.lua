The Terms of Reference (TOR) is a document that outlines the scope, objectives, and responsibilities of a project or team. It is used to define the project's purpose, deliverables, timelines, and the roles and responsibilities of the project team members. The TOR is usually created at the beginning of the project, during the planning phase, and is used as a reference throughout the project's lifecycle to ensure that the project is on track and that everyone involved knows what is expected of them.

The TOR typically includes the following information:

Background: A brief overview of the project and the reasons for undertaking it.

Objectives: The goals that the project aims to achieve and how these align with the overall business objectives.

Scope: The boundaries of the project and what is included and excluded.

Deliverables: The specific outputs or deliverables that will be produced by the project.

Timeline: The estimated timeline for the project, including key milestones or deadlines.

Budget: The estimated budget for the project, including any contingencies or reserves.

Risks: A description of the risks associated with the project and how they will be managed.

Assumptions and Dependencies: Any assumptions or dependencies that underpin the project.

Roles and Responsibilities: The roles and responsibilities of the project team members and stakeholders.

Governance: The project management and decision-making structures that will be used.

Communication Plan: The plan for communicating project information to stakeholders.

The Terms of Reference is a crucial document that provides a framework for the project and ensures that everyone involved is aligned on the project's goals and objectives. It is a reference document that can be used throughout the project to keep everyone on track and ensure that the project is delivered on time, within budget, and to the desired quality standards.
